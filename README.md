# job_listings_python_crawler

A coursera project to showcase how to scrape job listings from a popular job search platform.
At first, I thought I want to scrape the data from de.indeed.com. I did some research, analyisis
and simple tests using curl on cli, just to check if I can access the website easily.
Hence I decided to access other alternative, reed.co.uk. 

Relevant information are going to be extracted, such as: job titles, companies, locations, job descriptions, etc.

Here are the steps to do which I copied from coursera for this project:  

* Setup our development environment
* Understand the basics of web scraping
* Analyze the website structure of our job search platform
* Write the Python code to extract job data from our job search platform
* Save the data to a CSV file
* Test our web scraper and refine our code as needed
